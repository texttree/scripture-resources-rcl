Encouragement and instructions to show hospitality (1:2-8)<br>1. Diotrephes and Demetrius (1:9-12)<br>1. Conclusion (1:13-14)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 3 John?<br><br>The letter does not give the name of the author. The author only identified himself as **The elder** (1:1). The letter was probably written by the Apostle John near the end of his life.<br><br>### What is the Book of 3 John about?<br><br>John wrote this letter to a believer named Gaius. He instructed Gaius to be hospitable to fellow believers who were traveling through his area.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, **_3 John_** or **_Third John_**. Or they may choose a clearer title, such as **_The Third Letter from John_** or **_The Third Letter John Wrote_**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is hospitality?<br><br>Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. In 2 John, John discouraged Christians from showing hospitality to false teachers. In 3 John, John encouraged Christians to show hospitality to faithful teachers.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the author use family relationships in his letter?<br><br>The author used the terms **brother** and **children** in a way that can be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **brothers** to refer to Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to Christians. Also, John called some believers his **children**. These are believers he taught to obey Christ.<br><br>John also used the term **Gentile** in a way that could be confusing. The scriptures often used the term **Gentile** to refer to people who are not Jews. But in this letter, John used the word to refer to those who did not believe in Jesus.<br>
